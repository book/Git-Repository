=head1 NAME

Git::Repository::Command - Command objects for running git

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Git::Repository::Command;

    # invoke an external git command, and return an object
    $cmd = Git::Repository::Command->new(@cmd);

    # a Git::Repository object can provide more context
    $cmd = Git::Repository::Command->new( $r, @cmd );

    # options can be passed as a hashref
    $cmd = Git::Repository::Command->new( $r, @cmd, \%option );

    # $cmd is basically a hash, with keys / accessors
    $cmd->stdin();     # filehandle to the process' stdin (write)
    $cmd->stdout();    # filehandle to the process' stdout (read)
    $cmd->stderr();    # filehandle to the process' stdout (read)
    $cmd->pid();       # pid of the child process

    # done!
    $cmd->close();

    # exit information
    $cmd->exit();      # exit status
    $cmd->signal();    # signal
    $cmd->core();      # core dumped? (boolean)

    # cut to the chase
    my ( $pid, $in, $out, $err ) = Git::Repository::Command->spawn(@cmd);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Git::Repository::Command> is a class that actually launches a B<git>
commands, allowing to interact with it through its C<STDIN>, C<STDOUT>
and C<STDERR>.

This class is a subclass of L<System::Command>, meant to be invoked
through L<Git::Repository>.

=head1 METHODS

As a subclass of L<System::Command>,
L<Git::Repository::Command> supports the following methods:

=head2 new( @cmd )

Runs a B<git> command with the parameters in C<@cmd>.

If C<@cmd> contains a L<Git::Repository> object, it is used to provide
context to the B<git> command.

If C<@cmd> contains one or more hash reference, they are taken as
I<option> hashes. The recognized keys are:

=over 4

=item C<git>

The actual git binary to run. By default, it is just C<git>.

In case the C<git> to be run is actually a command with parameters
(e.g. when using B<sudo> or another command executer), the option value
should be an array reference with the command and parameters, like this:

    { git => [qw( sudo -u nobody git )] }

=item C<cwd>

The I<current working directory> in which the git command will be run.

=item C<env>

A hashref containing key / values to add to the git command environment.

=item C<input>

A string that is send to the git command standard input, which is then closed.

Using the empty string as C<input> will close the git command standard input
without writing to it.

Using C<undef> as C<input> will not do anything. This behaviour provides
a way to modify options inherited from C<new()> or a hash populated by
some other part of the program.

On some systems, some git commands may close standard input on startup,
which will cause a C<SIGPIPE> when trying to write to it. This will raise
an exception.

=item C<quiet>

Boolean option to control the output of warnings.

If true, methods such as C<final_output()> will not warn when Git outputs
messages on C<STDERR>.

=back

If the L<Git::Repository> object has its own option hash, it will be used
to provide default values that can be overridden by the actual option hash
passed to C<new()>.

If several option hashes are passed to C<new()>, they will all be merged,
keys in later hashes taking precedence over keys in earlier hashes.

The L<Git::Repository::Command> object returned by C<new()> has a
number of attributes defined (see below).


=head2 close()

Close all pipes to the child process, and collects exit status, etc.
and defines a number of attributes (see below).

=head2 final_output()

Collect all the output, and terminate the command.

Returns the output as a string in scalar context,
or as a list of lines in list context. Also accepts a hashref of options.

Lines are automatically C<chomp>ed.

If the Git command printed anything on stderr, it will be printed as
warnings. If the git sub-process exited with status C<128> (fatal error),
or C<129> (usage message), it will C<die()>.


=head2 Accessors

The attributes of a L<Git::Repository::Command> object are also accessible
through a number of accessors.

The object returned by C<new()> will have the following attributes defined:

=over 4

=item cmdline()

Return the command-line actually executed, as a list of strings.

=item pid()

The PID of the underlying B<git> command.

=item stdin()

A filehandle opened in write mode to the child process' standard input.

=item stdout()

A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard output.

=item stderr()

A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard error output.

=back

Regarding the handles to the child git process, note that in the
following code:

    my $fh = Git::Repository::Command->new( @cmd )->stdout;

C<$fh> is opened and points to the output of the git subcommand, while
the anonymous L<Git::Repository::Command> object has been destroyed.
Once C<$fh> is destroyed, the subprocess will be reaped, thus avoiding
zombies.

After the call to C<close()>, the following attributes will be defined:

=over 4

=item exit()

The exit status of the underlying B<git> command.

=item core()

A boolean value indicating if the command dumped core.

=item signal()

The signal, if any, that killed the command.

=back

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The core of L<Git::Repository::Command> has been moved into its own
distribution: L<System::Command>. Proper Win32 support is now delegated
to that module.

Before that, the Win32 implementation owed a lot to two people.
First, Olivier Raginel (BABAR), who provided me with a test platform
with Git and Strawberry Perl installed, which I could use at any time.
Many thanks go also to Chris Williams (BINGOS) for pointing me towards
perlmonks posts by ikegami that contained crucial elements to a working
MSWin32 implementation.
