      or no identity is configured

1.20 2011-06-09 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - None. It's as good as 1.19, without the stupid test fail.
    [TESTS]
    - one test always failed if run outside of a git repository,

      that does the git-specific error checking when collecting

      when the log command is incorrect (thanks to Lasse Makholm
      for the bug report and proposed patch)

1.18 2011-04-16 BOOK

      Git::Repository::Command::Reaper object.

      will now work as expected.
    [TESTS]

1.15 2011-01-11 BOOK

      (thanks to BinGOs for pointing me to a perlmonks post by ikegami,
      that contained working code)
    - Git::Repository::Log now has a raw_message() accessor, that
      returns the message with 4-space indent output by git log
      (Note that this change is INCOMPATIBLE with previous versions,
      in which message() returned the indented log message, and you
      had to make up your own "clean" version).
    [TESTS]
    - no more skipping tests under MSWin32, but there are some issues
      with the win32 code, as sometimes the output or errput of the git
      command is lost (HELP!)
    - bundle Test::Git, a module providing a few utility functions
      for testing code requiring a git repository

1.14 2010-10-27 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - complete rewrite of _has_git, which was renamed to _is_git,
      with a much improved cache for the "is this git valid?" info

      when there is no git in the PATH (fixes RT bug #62283,
      reported by Todd Rinaldo)
    - improved the plugin system design (thanks to Aristotle Pagaltzis)
    - fixes for making Git::Repository work with modules that do
      bad things to STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR (thanks to Todd Rinaldo)
    [TESTS]
    - improved tests on Win32 (thanks to Olivier Raginel (BABAR)
      for giving me access to a Win32 VM with Git installed)
    [BUGS]
    - sadly, the work on Win32 showed that Git::Repository doesn't
      fully support that platform, but the test suite safely skips
      the tests that hang under Win32. I hope to fix this over time.

1.13 2010-10-18 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - using 'git' as an option of a Git::Repository object now works
      as expected
    - version() also accepts option hashes
    - plugin system to load new keywords in the Git::Repository namespace
    - Git::Repository::Plugin::Log provides the log() method with the
      help of Git::Repository::Log and Git::Repository::Log::Iterator
      (Thanks to Todd Rinaldo and Aristotle Pagaltzis for discussions
      and ideas about what became the plugin system.)
    [TESTS]
    - tested against 120+ versions of git, including all versions
      of the 1.6.* and 1.7.* branches up until 1.7.3.1

1.12 2010-10-04 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]

    - if the input option is undef, it still means "don't touch stdin"

1.11 2010-10-02 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - fixed a bug in version comparison
      (version 1.7.1.209.gd60ad81 is smaller than 1.7.1.1.1.g66bd8ab)
    [TESTS]
    - skip tests that fail between between versions 1.7.1 and 1.7.1.1
      (thanks to SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni for the private report)
    - fix abs_path dying on Win32 with a path to a non-existent file
      (again)

1.10 2010-09-24 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]

1.07 2010-08-14 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - support for option hash in create(), which is attached to the
      returned Git::Repository object
    - accessors for Git::Repository::Command objects
      (including a 'cmdline' accessor)
    - removed the wc_subdir() attribute, which is useless and
      redundant with the cwd option
    - completely rewrote the repo_path and wc_path computation in new()
    - support new (post-v1.7.1) clone output in create()
    - less confusing names for options and attributes:
      + new() now takes git_dir and work_tree
        (instead of repository and working_copy)
      + the corresponding attributes are now git_dir and work_tree
        (instead of repo_path and wc_path)
      + the older options and attributes are being kept for compatibility
